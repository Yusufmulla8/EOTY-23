        Economist of the Year (EOTY) is an educational event tapping into every contestant's intellectual and enthusiastic side. It shall test the skills required in our dynamic world and reveal the economist hiding in you.
        
        EOTY has helped bring forward some great economists with colossal potential through its creative and innovative competitions.

Participants will use their academic knowledge and creative thinking to come up with solutions to some of the most challenging problems. 
        EOTY shall be judged by a panel of eminent academicians and scholars who are proficient in various fields of economics.

        Audentes Fortuna Iuvat
        <br>
        
        </span></p>
    <p class="event-details">Economics, like other fields, thrive on the existence of others to coexist from. Only when we all come together are we able to solve the world's problems. The first round for EOTY(Economist Of The Year) is exactly that. The participants are to join an online meet and would be given a choice of five subjects of great importance, ranging from Law to STEM( Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics). Five topics to keep the choices distinct without direct correlation to each other. 

        The game has been well thought out as even the topic the participants chosen subject would have a twist! The case studies are framed in a manner to judge their depth on both counts of Economics and their preference.
        
        One's choices have consequences; paying heed to the special twist in the round, we have aptly adopted the name Audentes Fortuna Iuvat, a.k.a, Fortune Favours The Bold.
        
        The top 50 from the myriad participants would receive their ticket for the second round! The second round shall test the vigour and risk appetite of our potential global economists.
        
        Fifty people with resources to grow, 
        shall try their best and start to sow. 
        The teachings of the previous round tell us that, Fortune Favours the Bold!

    <p><span class="w3-large w3-margin-right"> Round 2:

        Sic Parvis Magna
        
        <br>
        
        </span></p>
    <p class="event-details">The top 50 participants from the previous round have now been employed by crisis hit country. A G20 nation faces searing heat from the public and has lost its sheen in international waters. With GDP figures low and unemployment high, you have been tasked to rebuild the nation which currently lays in tatters. Do you come up  with something seminal or dig into your quiver for finding the magical arrows as proposed by the greats of economics? Your advice to the government is as good as implemented.

        The round has been aptly named “Sic Parvis Magna”, or Greatness from Humble Beginnings. Do you have the guts to call the shots?

    <p><span class="w3-large w3-margin-right"> Round 3 : 

        Panel Discussion
        
        <br>
        
        </span></p>
    <p class="event-details"> For the final stretch of the event, the final five candidates would be required to demonstrate their abilities in research coupled with communication, an assessment of two important skills required anywhere and everywhere. Research, as it is the true gospel to any question and Communication, a prerequisite when trying to influence and persuade.

        Being an event of Economics, we shall test the depth of their knowledge in the subject by having them apply their interpretations in real life situations, on current global troubles. Their works would be presented by the contestants themselves.
        
        Our esteemed panel would be the final judge of the works of the contestants. Based on their presentations in the third and final round, we select a victor as the coveted “Economist Of The Year, 2023”, indicating they have the skills of speed, critical thinking, knowledge and most importantly, tenacity!
